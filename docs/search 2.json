    "text": "This class will help students establish a core understanding of data visualization. We will consider how data type (including tabular, network, and spatial data) interacts with visualization task to guide design choices. Diverse types of visual encodings and how they relate to human perception will be presented, along with practical exercises using the R and Python programming languages. Upon completion of the course, students will understand WHY particular visualization approaches are effective for a given data set and HOW to implement those visualizations using the language of their choice. The course is designed to be “discipline agnostic” - each student is encouraged to use data sets that they deem important / interesting. The goal is to have students learn how to develop visualizations that are relevant to their own disciplinary interests.\n\n\nI am maintaining the course here and on its CANVAS PAGE (for enrolled students).\nSYLLABUS\nBarrie’s GitHub\n\n\nKB GitHub and KB Portfolio\nHS GitHub and HS Porfolio\nYG GitHub and YG Porfolio\nRS GitHub and RS Porfolio\nGT GitHub and GT Porfolio\nLR GitHub and LR Porfolio\n\n\n\n\nThe Functional Art\nGGSIDE!

    "text": "STRUCTURE\nThe basic formatting guidelines for this assignment are:\n\nInclude code fold or code tools options (or both) that allow users to view and copy your code while maintaining overall readability of your post.\nSuppress all output and warnings that might distract from your visualizations and writing.\nProperly title your assignment. The main title should be “BCB 520 - Final Project”, and the subtitle should be a descriptive title related to your question or topic.\nInclude author, date, categories, and a description in your YAML header.\nWrite clear, complete sentences for a target audience with some scientific background but little training in your specific discipline.\nInclude references if appropriate and use hyperlinks to external sources of data, inspiration, or examples.\nUse the header hierarchy and create a sensible document outline with white space. Format for readability! Use bold and italic fonts to emphasize things! Use color by customizing your .css file!\n\nIn addition to the above formatting guidelines, your portfolio post must contain the following sections:\n\nPreamble\nWrite a brief paragraph describing the primary question or purpose of the post. Ideally, the concept should be challenging enough that it requires at least two visualizations that use different idioms (ie. don’t just make two scatterplots with different variables). The concept should also be challenging enough that it captures the interest of the reader (i.e. a plot of height and weight that shows they are correlated is trivial and not appropriate). The best approach is to explore a topic or question in which YOU are very interested.\n\n\nData\nWrite a summary of the data sources you will use. Include a Data Dictionary table that fully describes each individual data file used. You may use your own research data or publicly available data from any source you like (with attribution). There aren’t any minimum or maximum data set size requirements, other than you need something big enough to be interesting and not so big that we don’t have a supercomputer capable of creating your visualization.\nNEW REQUIREMENT: Your assignment must feature one of the two new data types we have considered since the midterm: NETWORK DATA or SPATIAL DATA.\n\n\nVisualizations\nCreate your visualizations and include text that explains any steps or design choices. Be sure to include clearly labeled axes and a concise but complete figure caption for each visualization. Make deliberate choices for color palettes, point marks, line types, etc. Demonstrate that you understand the concepts we have covered!\n\n\nConclusions or Summary\nAnswer your research question. Draw a conclusion or inference related to your topic. Summarize your results. What new questions have emerged as a result of your visualizations? What interesting next steps have emerged?"

Logical flow of ideas.\n2. Adherence to format (10%): Did you follow directions?\n3. Topic suitability (15%): Is the topic interesting? Are the visualizations challenging and interesting enough to showcase your skills?\n4. Viz Execution (40%): Are the visualizations effective? Do they adhere to the principles of effectiveness? Are choices for idiom, marks, channels, etc made deliberately and well justified?\n5. Creativity (20%): Did you push your boundaries and learn new techniques? Is the overall post compelling and interesting? Are the visualizations inspiring, creative, unique, and generally impressive?
