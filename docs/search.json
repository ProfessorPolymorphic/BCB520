    "text": "Barrie D. Robison\nSpring 2025\n\n\nThis class will help students establish a core understanding of data visualization. We will consider how data type (including tabular, network, and spatial data) interacts with visualization task to guide design choices. Diverse types of visual encodings and how they relate to human perception will be presented, along with practical exercises using the R programming language. Upon completion of the course, students will understand WHY particular visualization approaches are effective for a given data set and HOW to implement those visualizations using R. The course is designed to be “discipline agnostic” - each student is encouraged to use data sets that they deem important / interesting. The goal is to have students learn how to develop visualizations that are relevant to their own disciplinary interests.\n\n\n\nStudents completing this course will be able to:\n\nDescribe and manipulate tabular, network, and spatial data; transform these data into a form suitable for visualization.\nAnalyze data visualization design choices related to marks and channels, spatial arrangement, and components of color.\nDesign new data visualizations with appropriate use of visual channels for tabular, network, and spatial data with quantitative and categorical attributes.\nImplement their data visualization designs using existing tools in R (or other toolkits preferred by the student).\nExplain whether a visual encoding is perceptually appropriate for a specific combination of task and data.\nDemonstrate their skills with at least two novel visualizations suitable for inclusion in an online Data Science Portfolio.\n\n\n\n\nTamara Munzner.

It contained this section, which I found amusing and have therefore retained. Professor Miller’s current university asks professors to have policies written into their syllabus about what students should do if the professor is more than 15 minutes late to class. Here is my version of that policy:\nI will inform students via e-mail in advance of class if class is cancelled for the day. Events that might create such a scenario include travel obligations that emerged after the semester has begun, a family emergency that encompasses multiple days, or some other thing. I will also contact our department secretary in emergent situations, such as something happening on the way to work. Failing that, assume the worst. Alien abduction, the return of one or more Old Ones to our plane, or some kind of attack by wizards are all viable explanations for my inability to attend class. I ask that the students make sure that my story gets the proper treatment on the “Mr. Ballen” YouTube channel. I also ask that my story be narrated by Morgan Freeman and that the role of me in the made for TV movie be played by Keanu Reeves or Danny DeVito.\n\n\n\nThe bad news is that there are NO make-ups for missed exams. Don’t bother asking. The good news is that there aren’t any exams.\n\n\n\nAll students are expected to uphold the highest standards of academic honesty.

Go ahead and log in to your account on the web and leave it open in a tab in your browser. There is a really great video about the next few steps (also linked below in RESORUCES) from Posit, but I’m giving you the condensed version here.\n\nFire up RStudio.\nGo to File-&gt;New Project and then select NEW DIRECTORY.\nNow select QUARTO BLOG.\nYou are going to create a the project in a new working directory. It is best practice to put this in a senstible directory structure on your local hard drive where your other GitHub repositories also live. Here is what mine looks like:\n\n 4. I suggest making the directory name something informative, like BCB504Portfolio, but hey… If you want to call your repository HasturBoxerShorts I won’t stop you. 5. Most of you will select Knitr as your Engine, but Cody “Mr. Hacker McPythonPants” might select Jupyter. 6. Check Create a git repository. The other boxes are optional and we can talk more about them later. 7. Click CREATE PROJECT.\nNow you’ve got a BLOG template all set up! Ha Ha! Onward to Internet Fame!\n\n\n1B - Make the BLOG about you.\nWe won’t spend a ton of time here, because this will be an ongoing process. You’ll go and watch all those cool videos and tutorials this weekend to figure this out. But lets do a couple things.\n\nMaybe you should modify the about.qmd file so that your name is in there somewhere.\nMaybe you should modify the index.qmd file with a better title in the YAML header.\nMaybe you should navigate to the posts folder, open the Welcome to my blog folder, open index.qmd from that directory, and add a sentence or two.\n\n\n\n1C - Customize your first post.\n\nNavigate to the posts folder, open the post with code folder, and open index.qmd.\nReplace ALL of the content of index.qmd with the most recent version of your .qmd file from ASSIGNMENT 2. Keep the file name index.qmd. Save that file!\nMove your data files to the post with code folder.\nRender the index.qmd file from this folder. Hopefully it worked!\n\n\n\n1D - Render the BLOG as a website.\n\nIMPORTANT Open your _quarto.yml file and add output-dir: docs under project:\n\n\nThe indentations matter here.\n\nSave all the files you’ve modified.\nGo to the BUILD tab in the (probably) top right section of RStudio.\nClick RENDER WEBSITE.\nClick through your new Blog and see how it works!\n\n\n\n1E - Push to GitHub.\nThere are quite a few ways to do this part. I’m going to use GitHub Desktop, but those video will show you other ways.\n\nGo to GitHub Desktop.\nType some text in the summary box.\nClick COMMIT TO MASTER.\nClick PUSH ORIGIN.\nGo to your GitHub in your browser. You should see your new repository! Yay!\n\n\n\n1F - Make it a website with GitHub pages.\n\nIn your browser, click on your repository.\nGo to SETTINGS.\nSelect PAGES.\nSet the SOURCE option to Deploy from a branch.\nSet the BRANCH to master and the directory to docs\nDeploy that stuff and wait. Then visit your site!"

This was represented as sets of ACTIONS that the user would perform (e.g. Discover, Present, Browse, Identify) on TARGETS related to the data set (e.g. Trends, Attributes, etc.).\nThink about one or two visualizations you wish to construct with your data, and try to define them in terms of ACTION - TARGET pairs. While you are at it, why don’t you update the index.qmd file of your BLOG POST with a new seciton at the bottom titled TASK ABSTRACTION, and put a sentence describing your visualizations and the ACTION - TARGET pairs they represent?\n\n\n2B Construct your Visualization\nLet’s get to work! Using whatever tools you can, code up your visualization in that new section of your BLOG post. You can check out how I approached this part in TUTORIAL 4."

    "text": "This class will help students establish a core understanding of data visualization. We will consider how data type (including tabular, network, and spatial data) interacts with visualization task to guide design choices. Diverse types of visual encodings and how they relate to human perception will be presented, along with practical exercises using the R and Python programming languages. Upon completion of the course, students will understand WHY particular visualization approaches are effective for a given data set and HOW to implement those visualizations using the language of their choice. The course is designed to be “discipline agnostic” - each student is encouraged to use data sets that they deem important / interesting. The goal is to have students learn how to develop visualizations that are relevant to their own disciplinary interests.\n\n\nI am maintaining the course here and I do not intend to use CANVAS this semester.\nSYLLABUS\nBarrie’s GitHub\n\n\nTo be populated by end of January.\n\n\n\n\nThe Functional Art\nGGSIDE!
