    "text": "This class will help students establish a core understanding of data visualization. We will consider how data type (including tabular, network, and spatial data) interacts with visualization task to guide design choices. Diverse types of visual encodings and how they relate to human perception will be presented, along with practical exercises using the R and Python programming languages. Upon completion of the course, students will understand WHY particular visualization approaches are effective for a given data set and HOW to implement those visualizations using the language of their choice. The course is designed to be “discipline agnostic” - each student is encouraged to use data sets that they deem important / interesting. The goal is to have students learn how to develop visualizations that are relevant to their own disciplinary interests.\n\n\nI am maintaining the course here and on its CANVAS PAGE (for enrolled students).\nSYLLABUS\nBarrie’s GitHub\n\n\n\nGGSIDE!

    "text": "ASSIGNMENT\nThe basic structure of this assignment is for you to identify, import, describe, and host a data set. I’ll break down the specifics for each of these actions below.\n\nIdentify a Data Set\nThe main criteria is that the data set has to matter to you in some way. Often, this will mean that it is your data set. It was collected by you and has a central role in your current or past graduate research. Awesome! Another scenario is that the data you want to use comes from your current job. Maybe it isn’t part of a research project, but you are motivated to learn how to better visualize the data or you are very interested in learning more about it. Also Awesome!\nSome of you might not have your own data. Perhaps you have just started your graduate training. Maybe your job doesn’t yet have data that you need to work with. No Problem!\nIt is perfectly fine to find publicly available data sets online. As long as the data set is interesting to you! You just need to make sure that the data:\n\nAre publicly available.\nAre not restricted by some kind of license or copyright.\nDo not contain private information.\nAre not covered by HIPPA, FERPA, CMMC, or other federal regulations related to data.\n\nIf you need help finding a data set, just let me know.\nSome fun potential categories for data sources include:\n\nSports Analytics from your favorite sport or team.\nPublicly available genomics data bases.\nKeggle.\nThe movie data base.\nClassic data sets from your field.\n\n\n\nImport the Data Set\nThis one is probably straightforward if your data set comes from your own research and lives on your local hard drive already.\n\n\nDescribe the Data Set\nThis is the bulk of the assignment. I want you to use the framework described in Dr. Munzner’s textbook to understand your data set and describe it to someone who is unfamiliar with your work. The basis of this approach is descibed in this lecture. In addition, this figure from the textbook summarizes the kinds of data types, data set types, and attribute types you might have in your data:\n\n\n\nBONUS OBJECTIVE: Host your Data Set\nUltimately, we are moving toward each of you hosting your assignments within an online repository that can serve as your data science portfolio. For this course, we are going to assume this is GitHub. At the very least, I want everyone to create (or dust off and log in to) your own GitHub account. We’ll try to use this assignment to set up a project repository, and perhaps even a simple web site using GitHub pages."
