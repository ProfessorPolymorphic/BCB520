Testing that idea.

```{r}

```


```{r}


# Assuming your dataframe is named nhl_data

# Step 1: Reshape the data

# Step 2: Calculate points per game
nhl_points <- nhl_long %>%
  mutate(points = case_when(
    team_goals > opponent_goals & is.na(overtime) ~ 2,  # Win without overtime
    team_goals > opponent_goals & !is.na(overtime) ~ 2, # Win with overtime
    team_goals < opponent_goals & !is.na(overtime) ~ 1, # Loss in overtime
    TRUE ~ 0  # Regular loss
  )) %>%

# Step 3: Summarize points by team and date
