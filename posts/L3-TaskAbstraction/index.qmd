## LAST LECTURE

Computer-based visualization systems provide visual representations of [datasets]{.red} designed to help people carry out tasks more effectively.

## FROM DOMAIN TO ABSTRACTION

![](domaintoabstract.png)

## KEY COMPONENTS OF TASK ABSTRACTION

**{[action]{.red}, [target]{.blue}} pairs**

Computer-based visualization systems provide visual representations of [datasets]{.blue} designed to help [people]{.red} carry out tasks more effectively.

## ACTIONS AND TARGETS

![](Whybig.png)

## ACTIONS - Analyze

::: columns
::: {.r-fit-text .column width="60%"}
-   [Consume:]{.red} Information has already been generated and stored as data.

    -   [Discover:]{.blue} new knowledge, test hypothesis, generate new hypothesis, verify
    -   [Present:]{.blue} communicate something specific and already understood
    -   [Enjoy:]{.blue} casual encounters with visualization

-   [Produce:]{.red} generate new material or information

    -   [Annotate:]{.blue} addition of graphical or text to existing visualization elements
    -   [Record:]{.blue} saves or captures visualization elements as persistent artifacts (screenshots, lists, parameter sets, annotations)
    -   [Derive:]{.blue} produce new data based on existing data (aka transform)

## ACTIONS - Search

::: columns
::: {.r-fit-text .column width="60%"}
-   [Lookup:]{.red} Location and target both known

    -   Example: Look up humans in the Tree of Life, knowing they are mammals.

-   [Locate:]{.red} Location unknown and target known

    -   Example: Look up rabbits in the Tree of Life, not knowing they are lagomorphs.

-   [Browse:]{.red} Location known and target unknown

    -   Example: Find any clades within Mammalia that have only one species.

-   [Explore:]{.red} Location unknown and target unknown

    -   Example: Searching for anomalies in time series data.

## ACTIONS - Query

::: columns
::: {.r-fit-text .column width="60%"}
-   [Query:]{.red} How much of the data matters to the task?

    -   Identify: One (specific Item, individual, cell, etc)
    -   Compare: Some (multiple targets)
    -   Summarize: All (very common, aka Overview)

## MANDATORY FUN {.scrollable .smaller}

**We will do these until everyone has done at least one example.**

```{webr-r}

Person <- c("Barrie", "Sharon","Betsy","John","Claire","Henry", "Marwa", "Justice")
Action <- c("Discover","Present", "Enjoy", "Annotate", "Record", "Derive", "Lookup", "Browse", "Locate", "Explore", "Identify", "Compare", "Summarize")
Target <- c("Trends", "Outliers", "Features", "Distribution", "Extremes", "Dependency", "Correlation", "Similarity", "Topology", "Paths")


sample_person <- sample(Person, 1)
sample_action <- sample(Action, 1)
sample_target <- sample(Target, 1)

# Printing the results
print(paste("Person:", sample_person))
print(paste("Action:", sample_action))
print(paste("Target:", sample_target))
```
