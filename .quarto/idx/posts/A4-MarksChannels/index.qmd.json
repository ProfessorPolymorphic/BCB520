Every time you create a figure, it needs a caption. The text in that section of your assignment should also briefly describe the data set you are using, especially the attributes used for the visualization. In addition, make sure the visualization task actually requires the particular concept. For example, don't just make a scatterplot with one red dot for the Popout exercise.

The most important attributes should be encoded with the most effective channels.\n\nUsing whatever data set you choose, create a visualization called Figure 1 that adheres to these two principles. Write a caption that explains your choices of marks and channels in these terms. Then, using the exact same data, create a visualization called Figure 2 that violates these principles in the most extreme ways you can imagine while still having the visualization be recognizibly the same as the first. Write a caption that explains your choices of marks and channels and why they are bad compared to Figure 1.\n\n### [Discriminability](../L4-Marks-Channels/index.qmd#DISCRIMINABILITY)\n\nUsing whatever data set you choose (it need not be the same data used for Figures 1 and 2), create a visualization called Figure 3 that uses a magnitude channel a number of bins that facilitate discriminiability of an attribute. Write a caption that explains your choices of marks and channels in these terms. Then, using the exact same data, create a visualization called Figure 4 that uses this same channel for WAY TOO MANY BINS, violating the guidelines for discriminability.

Write a caption that explains your choices of marks and channels in these terms. Then, using the exact same data, create a visualization called Figure 6 that uses channels that are integral, or at least much less separable. Write a caption that explains why choosing these channels is bad compared to Figure 5.\n\n### Popout\n\nUsing whatever data set you choose (it need not be the same data used for Figures 1-6... you get the idea), create a visualization called Figure 7 that effectively uses the concept of popout. Write a caption that explains your choices of marks and channels in these terms.
