## WHO ARE YOU?

"...The course is designed to be"discipline agnostic" - each student is encouraged to use data sets that they deem important / interesting. The goal is to have students learn how to develop visualizations that are relevant to their own disciplinary interests..."

### Briefly:

-   Your name
-   Your discipline
-   Your degree progress

## COURSE SUMMARY

Students completing this course will be able to:

::: r-fit-text
1.  Describe and manipulate tabular, network, and spatial data; transform these data into a form suitable for visualization.
2.  Make effective data visualization design choices related to marks and channels, spatial arrangement, and components of color.
3.  Design effective data visualizations for tabular, network, and spatial data with quantitative and categorical attributes.
4.  Implement their data visualization designs using existing tools in R (or other toolkits preferred by the student).
5.  Explain whether a visual encoding is perceptually appropriate for a specific combination of task and data.
6.  Demonstrate their skills with at least two novel visualizations suitable suitable for inclusion in an online Data Science Portfolio.

The course materials are located on [Canvas](https://canvas.uidaho.edu/courses/17806) and the [course website](https://github.com/ProfessorPolymorphic).

## VISUALIZATION

Computers provide [visual]{.red} representations of datasets designed to help people carry out tasks more effectively.
